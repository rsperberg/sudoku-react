## Game screen

The components for each cell will be able to display
- a blank cell
-   any number 1-9
-  a 3x3 grid of smaller numbers 1-9 for hints

When a cell is selected,
-  it's outlined in a remarkable color (actually, cd change background tint too or instead)
-  if it displays a number
    -  other cells displaying the same number are likewise outlined (or tinted), e.g., highlighted, in new color
    -  clicking on any number in the controls, changes the display number (and which other cells are highlighted)

Some control determines whether blank cells are blank or showing hint numbers
